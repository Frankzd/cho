CHO: A benchmark suite for OpenCL FPGA Accelerators
=================================================== 
Programming FPGAs with OpenCL is now becoming mainstream. However, unlike software, there are no benchmarks for evaluating these compilers. CHO is an attempt at providing  some sort of "standard" benchmark suite.

CHO is  a suite of benchmarks applications for OpenCL FPGA platforms. We started off by porting CHStone to OpenCL. We will be adding more applications with time. If you are new to FPGA or  OpenCL please read the papers below.
