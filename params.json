However, unlike software, there are no benchmarks for evaluating these compilers. CHO is an attempt at providing  some sort of \"standard\" benchmark suite.\r\n\r\nCHO is  a suite of benchmarks applications for OpenCL FPGA platforms. We started off by porting [CHStone][chstone] to OpenCL. We will be adding more applications with time. This paper (CHO: A Benchmark Suite for OpenCL-based FPGA Accelerators) is a good introduction/refresher on FPGA, OpenCL or High-level Synthesis.\r\n\r\nPapers\r\n======\r\n- [CHO: A Benchmark Suite for OpenCL-based FPGA Accelerators][techreport1]. <br>\r\n  Geoffrey Ndu, Mikel Lujan, Javier Navaridas. <br>\r\n  University Manchester Technical Report UNIMAN-COMP-APT-TR-02-05-2014.\r\n  May 2, 2014.\r\n\r\n[techreport1]: https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:228247\r\n[chstone]:http://www.ertl.jp/chstone/\r\n\r\n  \r\n","google":"<script>   (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){   (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),   m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)   })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');    ga('create', 'UA-52519328-1', 'auto');   ga('send', 'pageview');  </script>","note":"Don't delete this file!
